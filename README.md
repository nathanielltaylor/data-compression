### Huffman Compression
- Compresses text by building a binary tree of all of the characters used in the input text based on their frequency, which it then uses to assign each of these characters a prefix-free bit code
- The compressed text is generated by encoding each character as a string sequence of 1s and 0s unique to it; the full sequence is then unpacked into binary data
- Since none of these codes are prefixes of each other, decompression can be achieved by packing the binary data back into a string, parsing it, and translating each recognizable code back to its character using the character-code pairs from the binary tree
